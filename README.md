# Day 1 - Basic HTML Web Page

This project is part of my Week 3 internship assignment focused on front-end development. On Day 1, I learned and practiced the basics of HTML.

## âœ… What I Used
- Headings and paragraphs (`<h1>`, `<p>`)
- Sections with `<div>`
- Image using `<img>` (hosted online)
- Links using `<a>`
- A basic form with `<form>`, `<input>`, and a submit button

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To understand the structure of a web page and practice essential HTML tags.
