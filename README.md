Project Title: Day 1 - Basic HTML Web Page
üìå Description
This project is part of my Week 3 internship assignment focused on front-end development. On Day 1, I learned the foundational structure of a web page using HTML. This includes the use of key HTML tags such as:

<h1> for headings

<p> for paragraphs

<div> for sectioning content

<img> for displaying images

<a> for adding clickable links

<form> for creating basic input forms

Through this task, I built a simple and clean web page that contains:

A welcome message

A short "About Me" section

My image hosted online

A clickable GitHub profile link

A "Contact Me" form with name and email fields

This project helped me understand how to build the structure of any webpage using semantic and functional HTML tags.
